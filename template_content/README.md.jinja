# {{ service_name }}

{{ service_display_name }} dynamic producer for Akeyless

The payload for this producer looks like:

```
{"placeholder": "[YOUR_PLACEHOLDER_VALUE_HERE]"}
```

Call `{{ package_name }}.build_{{ package_name }}_producer()` to initialize the create{% if service_supports_rotation %}/rotate{% endif %}{% if service_supports_revocation %}/revoke{% endif %} endpoints.  You can
optionally provide the `url` parameter which will add a prefix to the endpoints.  This can then be attached to a
[clearskies context](https://clearskies.info/docs/context/index.html) or an [endpoint group](https://clearskies.info/docs/endpoint-groups/endpoint-groups.html):

If used as a producer, it will use the provided credentials to fetch and return {{ service_display_name }} credentials or tokens.{% if service_supports_rotation %} It can also rotate the credentials you provide.{% endif %}{% if service_supports_revocation %} Additionally, it supports revoking credentials when they are no longer needed.{% endif %}

## Installation

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
uv add {{ pypi_package_name }}
```

```bash
pip install {{ pypi_package_name }}
```

or

```bash
pipenv install {{ pypi_package_name }}
```

or

```bash
poetry add {{ pypi_package_name }}
```

## Development

To set up your development environment with pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies (including dev)
uv sync


# Install dev dependencies (including ruff, black, mypy) in the project environment
uv pip install .[dev]

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Optionally, run pre-commit on all files
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Usage Example

```python
import clearskies
import {{ package_name }}

wsgi = clearskies.contexts.WsgiRef(
    {{ package_name }}.build_{{ service_name|replace('-', '_') }}_producer()
)
wsgi()
```

Which you can test directly using calls like:

```
curl 'http://localhost:8080/sync/create' -d '{"payload":"{\"placeholder\":\"YOUR_VALUE_HERE\"}"}'

{% if service_supports_rotation %}
curl 'http://localhost:8080/sync/rotate' -d '{"payload":"{\"placeholder\":\"YOUR_VALUE_HERE\"}"}'
{% endif %}

{% if service_supports_revocation %}
curl 'http://localhost:8080/sync/revoke' -d '{"payload":"{\"placeholder\":\"YOUR_VALUE_HERE\"}"}'
{% endif %}
```

**NOTE:** Akeyless doesn't store your payload as JSON, even when you put in a JSON payload.  Instead, it ends up as a stringified-json
(hence the escaped apostrophes in the above example commands).  This is normal, and normally invisible to you, unless you try to invoke the
endpoints yourself.
